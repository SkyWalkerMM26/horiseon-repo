The purpose of this project is to make a webpage for a marketing agency to meet accessibility standards so it can be optimized for search engines. 

Criteria

* Make sure elements follow a logical structure.
* Input alt attributes to images.
* Make sure Headings are squential order.
* Make title concise and descriptive.


**Action**
I begin with the starter code that was given. Without changing the physical appearance of the page, I had tried to clean style.css file that was used for the index.html. There was a lot do reduncy that can be optimized in style.css, so I deleted some and put it into one so the style.code sheet looks more clean. Because I had made some edits to the style.css file, I have to make sure the coding in the index.html file correlates with the changes. The goal was to make this more web accessible so I had make sure we use proper semantic elements to define the code portions properly.

**Sources use to get this done!**
