The purpose of this project is to make a webpage for a marketing agency to meet accessibility standards so it can be optimized for search engines. 

## Criteria
* Use semantic HTML elements.
* Make sure elements follow a logical structure.
* Input alt attributes to images.
* Make sure Headings are squential order.
* Make title concise and descriptive.

## Action 

I begin with the starter code that was given. Without changing too much of the physical appearance of the page, I had tried to clean the style.css file that was used for the index.html. There was a lot do reduncy that can be optimized in style.css, so I categorized some of the styles into one. Because I had made some edits to the style.css file, I have to make sure the coding in the index.html file correlates with the changes. The goal was to make this more web accessible so I had make sure I used proper semantic elements to define the code portions properly in the index.html file.

**Sources use to get this done!**
1. Git Hub
2. VS Code
3. Terminal
